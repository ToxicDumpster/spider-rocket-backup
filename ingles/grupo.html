    <p>My name is Iuri Carati dos Santos Polita, and I study at Etec Maria Cristina Medeiros (MCM). I'm 15 years old and I'm in the high school program with a focus on information technology. My favorite hobbies involve technology in general and gaming. I consider games as a form of art within technology where you can experience storytelling, listen to music, and more within a unique media content.<br></p>My goal with this project is to try to gain more recognition for public schools and to acquire more experience and opportunities for myself and my colleagues. If my plan works, I hope that everyone involved can secure good opportunities for the future.

        My name is Enzo Móbile de Oliveira, I am 15 years old, and I study at Etec Maria Cristina Medeiros in Ribeirão Pires, in the high school program with a focus on information technology. I have 2 cats at home, and I have a strong interest in art in general, with a particular focus on music. I have a bass guitar that I use to practice from time to time, and I also enjoy singing lyrics from various bands. I am very fond of the world of rock and metal and their subgenres. I don't like the way society is driven by the current production system, and I am not a fan of the direction technology is heading. I love nature, philosophy, and reading, which are three essential things in my life.

        <p>I am Denner Pereira dos Santos, a student at Maria Cristina Medeiros School (E.T.E.C, Centro Paula Souza), in the first year of high school with a professional focus on the internet. I intend to give my best in my projects, working hard to graduate and pursue a career in the field. I plan to attend college in the area of database management, which is essential for securing data for any company.<br></p>
        <p>My biggest academic dream is to work in a stable job that is both financially rewarding and enjoyable. I aspire to work for large companies, such as DXC Technology, which is a highly regarded brand for those pursuing a career as a skilled programmer. This is especially beneficial for individuals living in larger cities, which is one of the reasons why I plan to relocate to the city center. Doing so will help me find employment more quickly and with greater ease. <br></p>

        <p>My name is Amanda Rodriguez Silva, I am 15 years old, and I am a student at Etec Maria Cristina Medeiros. I am currently in the first year of high school with a professional focus on the internet. I started my studies and exploration of this field this year, and I am continually learning and discovering new things. Throughout my life, I have attended schools with the best possible educational resources to help me reach my goals. I have always recognized the privileges my parents have provided me, and I use them as motivation to strive for the best in both my personal and professional life.<br></p>I have a strong interest in Information Technology (IT), and it's a field that will likely offer many job opportunities with great salaries in the future. However, I am not sure if I will ultimately pursue a career in this area. My goal is to attend UFABC (Federal University of ABC), and I know that I have to dedicate myself and study hard to pass the entrance exams and achieve my objectives for adulthood and beyond. The guidance provided by our teachers plays a crucial role in terms of research and self-discovery

        <p>My name is Gabriela Helena, I am 15 years old, and I am in the 1st year of high school at ETEC Ribeirão Pires, studying in the field of Information Technology. My goal is to complete high school and graduate in the field of information technology. I intend to study a bit of everything I enjoy that is related to the technology field, so I can decide on a profession for my future.<br></p><p>My academic dream is to work in a stable place that makes me financially happy. I am still looking for colleges, and I don't have anything specific in mind yet. I intend to keep searching and learning so that, down the road, I can determine what I truly want for my future.
            This job will stimulate me a bit more about what I will work on in the future, as well as help me further decide what I really want.<br></p><p>One of the aspects that interests me the most in this field is robotics because it's an area with significant technological advancements worldwide. Additionally, it will help me understand what might not take me away from this position.

                One of the reasons I chose the field of information technology is both the competition and the fact that it's a job that is difficult to be replaced in the future by robots and other IT-related technologies.</p>
